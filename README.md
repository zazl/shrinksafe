==========

Fork of Dojo Shrinksafe. Baseline obtained from http://download.dojotoolkit.org/release-1.8.3/dojo-release-1.8.3-shrinksafe.zip

The purpose of this repo is to provide a version of shrinksafe that works with Mozilla Rhino v1.7R3 and above. Starting with v1.7R3
the Rhino code modified some of its internal API's that affected the shrinksafe code.
